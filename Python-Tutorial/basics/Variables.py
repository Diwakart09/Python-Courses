# Basics of variables in Python
# input and raw input
x = 18
print(x + 3)
print(x ** -3)

# User input
# input() function checks datatype whereas raw_input doesn't
# i.e. input() function won't allow us string as input, as x was previously used as an integer above ^_^
x = input("Enter a number: ")
print(x)

input()
